## Catwoman

Oh the mischievous and trouble making anti-hero from the Batman series. Despite Batman's best efforts, she always seems to slip away in end with jewels a plenty in hand. In this short post, I'll go over the notable appearances of Catwoman in her animated roles.

## Batman: The Animated Series (1996)

Below you can see Catwoman in what is likely her most popular animated appearance, from everyone's favorite BTAS. I must say that I do very much like the design. The softness of the round design is accented well with the sharp edges of her ears and eyes; really does capture the double sided nature of catwoman excellently.

## The Batman (2004)

This post's main GIF is of [Catwoman](https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/Catwoman_(Matsudaverse)) from the 2004 The Batman TV series. The design is particular striking with its large cat ears, yellow goggles, and red accents. This version also seems more devious than previous and future iterations of the character. You definitely don't want to mess with this feisty lady.

## Batman: The Brave and The Bold (2008)

How can we forget Catwoman from The Brave and the Bold! This version looks, dare I say, more older to previous iterations. According to the [wiki](https://braveandbold.fandom.com/wiki/Catwoman), this version is heavily inspired from the Earth-2/Golden Age version of Catwoman. Look at those round ears though! So adorable.

## The Dark Knight Returns (2012)

Here you can see Selina Kyle after she hangs up her catwoman costume (20-25 after her prime thieving years) and now works as the head of Gotham's most profitable escort service. I found this appearance interesting as its fairly rare to see Selina Kyle in her later years.

## Batman: The Caped Crusader (2024)

This version looks very similar to the version from The Brave and the Bold with the pointy ears being the aspect that stands out most in contrast. According to this cute catwoman [website](https://www.catwomanfan.com), this version is inspired from the silver age Catwoman. See below for an example from the 1966 Lois Lane #70 issue. I almost forgot to mention that Catwoman in the Caped Crusader is voiced by Christina Ricci, most well known for her work on Addams family and Casper. She also voiced Terra in the Teen Titans movie, The Judas Contract.
